# Web3J workshop

As a part of JaxLondon's 4 day conference, there was a 1 day workshop on using Web3J to develop smart contracts.

Smart contracts are programs that are executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Instructions for use:

Prerequisites:
 
 install a geth client
 connect to the Ethereum network (Rinkeby, etc.)
 you will want to install the web3j command line tools
 you will need a wallet on the corresponding network
 Solidity should be installed locally as the commands will be compiled and executed as EVM bytecode
 
 
ABI files are application binary interfaces... these are the bindings for the various inputs/outputs/method declarations.
You will get a .bin binary file for anything you compile using Solidity.
